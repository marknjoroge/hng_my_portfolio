# hng_my_portfolio


## Project description

This is a flutter application built on `8th September 2023` for `#Task 1` of the `HNG internship` `mobile internship` program.


## Tech

As advised, I kept the number of dependencies to the minimum.
However, webviews are not native to flutter and I therefore had to use the `webview_flutter`
library to implement the functionality.
